# Learning Clojure

Clojure is an elegant programming language for a more civilized development experience.

Clojure encourages the creation of simple software systems using immutable values and a pragmatic approach to pure functional design.

The aim of Learning Clojure is to cover the essentials required to start a journey into the Clojure programming language.

!!! QUOTE "Patients, Practice and Time"
    Learning any programming language takes a lot of patients, practice and time to feel comfortable.
