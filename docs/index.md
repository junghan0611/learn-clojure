# Learning Clojure

!!! QUOTE "Patients, Practice and Time"
    Learning any programming language takes a lot of patients, practice and time to feel comfortable.

A journey into Clojure should include the following aspects

- Clojure REPL workflow
- Clojure editor choice and usage
- Clojure Syntax (list as function call, prefix notation, dynamic types, data structures)
- Clojure standard library (commonly used functions)
- Common libraries

The foundational aspects are inter-related so a slice through each of them is usually the most effective approach.

## Practice

- code challenges websites (Exercism, 4Ever Clojure)
- small projects
- identify meaningful projects


## Experiment in the REPL

- call functions from clojure core
- write custom functions
- create symbol names that represent a value
  - a function call always returns a value
  - a function call is therefore a value
- Theory: homoiconicity - the same (homo) icons (syntax) is used for behaviour and data



## Navigate the book

Use the mouse or built-in key bindings to navigate the pages of the book

- ++p++ , ++comma++ : go to previous page
- ++n++ , ++period++ : go to next page

Use the search box to quickly find a specific topic

- ++f++ , ++s++ , ++slash++ : open search dialog
- ++arrow-down++ , ++arrow-up++ : select next / previous result
- ++esc++ , ++tab++ : close search dialog
- ++enter++ : follow selected result

All sponsorship recieved is used to maintain and further develop the [Practicalli series of books and videos](https://practical.li/){target=_blank}, although most of the work is still done with my own time and cost.

Thank you to [Cognitect](https://www.cognitect.com/){target=_blank}, [Nubank](https://nubank.com.br/){target=_blank} and a wide range of other [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/practicalli-john#sponsors){target=_blank} from the Clojure community for your continued support
