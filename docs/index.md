# Learning Clojure


!!! QUOTE "Patients, Practice and Time"
    Learning any programming language takes a lot of patients, practice and time to feel comfortable.


## Learning path overview

A journey into Clojure should include the following aspects

- Clojure REPL workflow
- Clojure editor choice and usage
- Clojure Syntax (list as function call, prefix notation, dynamic types, data structures)
- Clojure standard library (commonly used functions)
- Common libraries

The foundational aspects are inter-related so a slice through each of them is usually the most effective approach.


## Practice

- code challenges websites (Exercism, 4Ever Clojure)
- simple projects
- identify meaningful projects


### Experiment in the REPL
- call functions from clojure core
- write custom functions
- create symbol names that represent a value
  - a function call always returns a value
  - a function call is therefore a value
- Theory: homoiconicity - the same (homo) icons (syntax) is used for behaviour and data
