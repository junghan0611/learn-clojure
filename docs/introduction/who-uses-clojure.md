# Who uses Clojure

[Hundreds of companies](http://clojure.org/community/companies) actively advertised their Clojure adoption. Given the broad participation in user groups there are many more organizations using Clojure within their technology stack.

A quick scan of various job sites shows Clojure positions at companies like Walmart, Facebook, Staples, Consumer Reports, Salesforce, and Amazon. It doesn't get much more mainstream than that.
