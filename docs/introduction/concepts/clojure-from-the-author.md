# Clojure from the Author

A series of important videos from Rich Hickey, the author of Clojure who spent over 2 years designing core of Clojure around the concept of simplicity.  Since then Rich has stewarded the continued design and development of Clojure, along with the Cognitect team, ensuring Clojure stays true to is founding principles.

!!! HINT "Try Clojure in the REPL"
    The videos can be watched at any time during the journey into Clojure.  

    An effective way to learn and become comfortable with Clojure is to write code and evaluate it in the REPL.

Presentations by Rich Hickey are an excellent way understand the design philosophy behind Clojure and support adoption of Clojure as a highly effective language for software development.

## Clojure made simple

Covers the major problems with software development and the challenges most programming languages fail to tackle completely.

Discusses a simple approach to software development and the big picture view of how Clojure solves these problems

## Simplicity Matters

!!! QUOTE Rich Hickey, Clojure Benevolent Dictator for Life
    As we move forward we have to take what we already have and make that [software] do more, make it do things differently, make it do things better,  

    ... as we try to take on manipulating software we are ... challenged to understand it in order to make that happen.

    ... I'll contend that you will completely be dominated by complexity.  I don't care what processes you are using, I don't care how well you test or anything else.  

    Complexity will dominate what you do.

## The value of values

Rich Hickey provides analysis of the changing way we think about values (not the philosophical kind) in light of the increasing complexity of information technology and the advent of Big Data
